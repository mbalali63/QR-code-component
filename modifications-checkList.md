## Modifications List
This following list shows the modification proposed by Frontend  Mentor Robot and also by Frontend mentor users.
I will go through, and fix them all, one by one. [@Blackpachamame](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Blackpachamame), is the user who provided valueable comments on my project.


- [x] Document should have one main landmark
    HTML5 Semantic elements, and/or ARIA landmark regions must be used.
- [x] Page should contain a level-one heading
- [s] All page content should be contained by landmarks
- [x] To improve the semantics of your HTML, you can change your 
       ``` <div class="container">``` to a ```<main class="container">``` and the ```<div class="attribution">``` to a ```<footer class="attribution">```
- [x] Should be h1 instead of h2
- [x] Instead of using margin to center your content in the center of the screen, you can use the flexbox properties in the body:
- [x] The background color is not the same as the original design, nor the title of the card. You should check that, unless you changed it on your own

My Modifications:
- [x] The card must be located at the center of the page
